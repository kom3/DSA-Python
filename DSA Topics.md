# Important topics in DSA

1. Array & Strings
- sliding window
  - 2 Types(fixed size window + Variable size window + Bit manipulation)
  - Patterns (f/v window + hash map/count/sum/avg/frequency map + Bit manipulation)
- Two pointer
- Prefix Sum
- Dynamic programming - memorization & tabulation (need more practice)
- Sorting (need to memorize)
  buble, selection, insertion, quick, count, radix, merge, heap
- Searching, linear & binary search
- Problems related to combinations
- Recursion, include and exclude nesting 

2. Stack
- Min stack
- Infix to postfix
- Basic math operator related problems

3. Queue,  
- Circuler Q
- DeQueue
- Priority queue 

4. Linked List
- Singly
- Doubly
- Circular singly
- Circular doubly
- Floyd's Cycle-Finding
- Stack & Q implementation

5. Recursion

6. Trees 
- Binary trees
- Traversing binary tree
- Huffman's tree
- Binary search tree (BST)
- Search, insert, delete, height of tree, total number of nodes, smallest & largest node in BST
- Threaded binary tree to avoid recursion most of time
- LCA(lowest common ancestor)

7. Graphs
- Transitive closure of directed graph
- DFS
- BFS
- Shortest path to node (Dijkstra, Bellman ford, floyd warshall, A* algorithm)
- Minimum spanning tree (krushal & prims)
- Hamiltonian Cycle 
- Traveling salesman & with backtracking
- Detect cycle in graph
- Union find (reguler, with ranking, Ranking & path compression - allows to find non cycled path from a cycled graph) 
- Topological sorting (used to find the dependency of a node in order)
- Bipartite graph
- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (maximum flow between two points)
- Edmonds-Karp algorithm (maximum flow between two points)

8. Tries
- Trie (insertion, search, auto-completion, deletion)
- Ternary search tree (TST)


9. Heap & priority queue


10. Backtracking


11. Advance tree
- AVL Trees (self balancing tree O(logn) insert,del,update)
- Red black tree  (self-balancing tree for frequent insertion and less search)
- Splay tree: (caching purpose) will be used as similarly to LinkedList & Array to store data to efficient and fast access the frequently used values
- B Tree (self-balancing, used in DBs)
- B+ Trees (self-balancing, used in DBs)


**Approach** 
- Bruteforce
- Backtracking
- Greedy
- Dynamic programming (memoristaion & Tabulation)
- Heuristic algorithms
