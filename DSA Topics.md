# Important topics in DSA

__1. Array & Strings__
- Sliding window
  - 2 Types - Fixed size window & Variable size window
  - Patterns (f/v window + hash map/count/sum/avg/frequency map + Bit manipulation + Prefix sum)
- Two pointer
- Prefix Sum
- Dynamic programming:
  - Memoization: A top-down dynamic programming approach where you use recursion and store results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.
  - Tabulation: A bottom-up dynamic programming approach where you iteratively build solutions from smaller subproblems, usually using loops.
- Sorting (need to memorize)
  buble, selection, insertion, quick, count, radix, merge, heap
- Searching, linear & binary search
- Problems related to combinations
- Recursion, include and exclude nesting 

__2. Stack__
- Min stack
- Infix to postfix
- Basic math operator related problems

__3. Queue,__  
- Circuler Q
- DeQueue
- Priority queue 

__4. Linked List__
- Singly
- Doubly
- Circular singly
- Circular doubly
- Floyd's Cycle-Finding
- Stack & Q implementation

__5. Recursion__

__6. Trees__
- Binary trees
- Traversing binary tree
- Huffman's tree
- Binary search tree (BST)
- Search, insert, delete, height of tree, total number of nodes, smallest & largest node in BST
- Threaded binary tree to avoid recursion most of time
- LCA(lowest common ancestor)

__7. Graphs__
- Transitive closure of directed graph
- DFS
- BFS
- Shortest path to node (Dijkstra, Bellman ford, floyd warshall, A* algorithm)
- Minimum spanning tree (krushal & prims)
- Hamiltonian Cycle 
- Traveling salesman & with backtracking
- Detect cycle in graph
- Union find (reguler, with ranking, Ranking & path compression - allows to find non cycled path from a cycled graph) 
- Topological sorting (used to find the dependency of a node in order)
- Bipartite graph
- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (maximum flow between two points)
- Edmonds-Karp algorithm (maximum flow between two points)

__8. Tries__
- Trie (insertion, search, auto-completion, deletion)
- Ternary search tree (TST)


__9. Heap & priority queue__


__10. Backtracking__


__11. Advance tree__
- AVL Trees (self balancing tree O(logn) insert,del,update)
- Red black tree  (self-balancing tree for frequent insertion and less search)
- Splay tree: (caching purpose) will be used as similarly to LinkedList & Array to store data to efficient and fast access the frequently used values
- B Tree (self-balancing, used in DBs)
- B+ Trees (self-balancing, used in DBs)


**Approach** 
- Bruteforce
- Backtracking
- Greedy
- Dynamic programming (memoristaion & Tabulation)
- Heuristic algorithms
