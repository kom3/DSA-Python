We’ll go in **three phases**:

1. **Two Pointers Theory (mental model)**
2. **Common Patterns Interviewers Expect**
3. **Guided Practice → You think, I guide → then I test you**

## 1️⃣ Two Pointers: Core Theory

### What is the Two Pointers Technique?

It’s an optimization strategy where **two indices move through a data structure (usually an array or string)** instead of using nested loops.

**Why it matters**

* Brute force: `O(n²)`
* Two pointers: `O(n)` or `O(n log n)`
* Interviewers LOVE it because it shows **problem reduction and invariants**

---

### When Should You Think “Two Pointers”?

Ask yourself:

> “Can I solve this by keeping track of two positions instead of rechecking everything?”

Typical clues:

* **Sorted array**
* **Looking for pairs / triplets**
* **Subarray / substring**
* **Reversing / partitioning**
* **Comparing from both ends**

---

## 2️⃣ Two Pointers Patterns (Very Important)

Interviewers aren’t testing problems—they’re testing **patterns**.

---

### 🔹 Pattern 1: Opposite Direction Pointers

**Pointers start at both ends**

```
left = 0
right = n - 1
```

📌 Used when:

* Array is **sorted**
* Want to compare smallest + largest
* Want symmetry

📌 Examples:

* Two Sum II
* Valid Palindrome
* Container With Most Water

🧠 Key invariant:

> Everything outside `left` and `right` is already processed

---

### 🔹 Pattern 2: Same Direction (Fast & Slow)

**Both pointers move forward**

```
slow = 0
fast = 0
```

📌 Used when:

* Removing duplicates
* Filtering elements
* In-place modifications

📌 Examples:

* Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
* Move Zeroes
* Remove Element

🧠 Key invariant:

> `slow` tracks valid data, `fast` explores

---

### 🔹 Pattern 3: Sliding Window (Advanced Two Pointers)

**Window expands and contracts**

```
left = 0
for right in range(n):
    expand window
    while invalid:
        shrink window
```

📌 Used when:

* Subarray/substring problems
* Longest / shortest / count conditions

📌 Examples:

* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
* Minimum Window Substring
* Max Consecutive Ones III

🧠 Key invariant:

> Window `[left, right]` always satisfies (or almost satisfies) a condition

---

### 🔹 Pattern 4: Partitioning

**Rearranging elements based on a condition**

📌 Examples:

* Dutch National Flag
* Sort Colors
* Move Negatives to One Side

🧠 Think “quicksort partition logic”

---

## 3️⃣ FAANG Interview Strategy (VERY IMPORTANT)

Interviewers expect:

1. **Brute force first**
2. Identify bottleneck
3. Say:
   👉 “We can optimize using two pointers”
4. Explain pointer movement rules clearly

❌ Bad:

> “I’ll just use two pointers”

✅ Good:

> “Since the array is sorted, increasing the left pointer increases the sum and decreasing the right pointer decreases the sum.”

---

## 4️⃣ Guided Practice (You Think First)

### 🧪 Problem 1: Two Sum II (Sorted Array)

**Problem**
Given a sorted array, find two numbers that add up to a target.

**Brute force**

* Try all pairs → `O(n²)`

**Now you:**
👉 **Where should the two pointers start?**
👉 **When do you move left vs right?**

(Answer in words, not code.)

---

### 🧪 Problem 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

**Key idea**

* In-place
* Keep unique elements at the front

👉 What does `slow` represent?
👉 What does `fast` represent?

---

### 🧪 Problem 3: Valid Palindrome

Given a string, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.

👉 Why is opposite-direction two pointers optimal here?
👉 When do pointers move?

---

## 5️⃣ Interview-Level Challenge (Think Carefully)

### 🧠 Problem 4: Container With Most Water

**Why brute force fails**
**Why moving the taller pointer is WRONG**

👉 Which pointer do you move and why?

(This question alone shows FAANG-level understanding.)
