# 125. Valid Palindrome

# A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "race a car"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = " "
# Output: true
# Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
# Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
# s consists only of printable ASCII characters.


def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    l, r = 0, len(s) - 1

    while l < r:
        # skip non-alphanumeric from left
        while l < r and not s[l].isalnum():
            l += 1

        # skip non-alphanumeric from right
        while l < r and not s[r].isalnum():
            r -= 1

        # compare lowercase characters
        if s[l].lower() != s[r].lower():
            return False

        l += 1
        r -= 1

    return True
