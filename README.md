# Important topics in DSA

1. Array & Strings
- sliding window
  - 2 Types(fixed size window + Variable size window)
  - Patterns (f/v window + hash map/count/sum/avg/frequency map)
- two pointer
- dynamic programming - memorization & tabulation (need more practice)
- sorting (need to memorize)
  buble, selection, insertion, quick, count, radix, merge, heap
- searching, linear & binary search
- problems related to combinations
- recursion, include and exclude nesting 

2. Stack
- Min stack
- infix to postfix
- basic math operator related problems

4. Queue,  
- circuler Q
- DeQueue
- priority queue 

6. Linked List
- Doubly
- circular
- circular doubly
- Floyd's Cycle-Finding
- stack & Q implementation

7. Recursion

9. Trees 
- Binary trees
- traversing binary tree
- Huffman's tree
- binary search tree (BST)
- search, insert, delete, height of tree, total number of nodes, smallest & largest node in BST
- threaded binary tree to avoid recursion most of time
- LCA(lowest common ancestor)

10. Graphs
- Transitive closure of directed graph
- DFS
- BFS
- shortest path to node (Dijkstra, Bellman ford, floyd warshall, A* algorithm)
- minimum spanning tree (krushal & prims)
- Hamiltonian Cycle 
- traveling salesman & with backtracking
- detect cycle in graph
- union find (reguler, with ranking, Ranking & path compression - allows to find non cycled path from a cycled graph) 
- Topological sorting (used to find the dependency of a node in order)
- bipartite graph
- Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (maximum flow between two points)
- Edmonds-Karp algorithm (maximum flow between two points)

11. Tries
- trie (insertion, search, auto-completion, deletion)
- ternary search tree (TST)


12. Heap & priority queue


13. Backtracking


14. Advance tree
- AVL Trees (self balancing tree O(logn) insert,del,update)
- Red black tree  (self-balancing tree for frequent insertion and less search)
- Splay tree: (caching purpose) will be used as similarly to LinkedList & Array to store data to efficient and fast access the frequently used values
- B Tree (self-balancing, used in DBs)
- B+ Trees (self-balancing, used in DBs)
